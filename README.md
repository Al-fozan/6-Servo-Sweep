# 6-Servo Sweep Project

This Arduino project controls **6 servo motors** connected to digital pins **2 to 7**.

### ðŸ”§ Features
- All six servos sweep from 0Â° to 180Â° in smooth motion.
- After the sweep, each servo holds position at 90Â°.
- Code is optimized using arrays and loops for clean structure.

## ðŸ“‹ Components Used
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- 6x Servo motors
- Jumper wires
- External power supply (recommended for 6 servos)

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Connect each servo to pins **2 to 7**.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino.
3. The servos will sweep for ~2 seconds, then all hold at 90Â°.
4. Done!
